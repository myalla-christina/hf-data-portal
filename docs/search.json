    "text": "Why this portal exists\nReliable, geocoded health facility data remain scarce across many malaria-endemic African countries. Existing datasets are often fragmented, stored in PDF formats, or lack the standardization required for spatial and mathematical modelling.\nThis portal addresses this gap by extracting, cleaning, and structuring facility profile data into analysis-ready formats."
