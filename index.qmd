# Geocoded Health Facility Data for Malaria-Endemic Africa

This portal provides harmonized, facility-level demographic, service,  
and equipment data across malaria-endemic African countries.  
The data are structured to directly support malaria modelling,  
spatial accessibility analysis, and health systems research.

## Why this portal exists

Reliable, geocoded health facility data remain scarce across many malaria-endemic African countries. Existing datasets are often fragmented, stored in PDF formats, or lack the standardization required for spatial and mathematical modelling.

This portal addresses this gap by extracting, cleaning, and structuring facility profile data into analysis-ready formats.

## What this portal provides

-   Harmonized facility-level datasets across countries
-   Consistent classification of services and facility attributes
-   Geographic coordinates suitable for spatial modelling
-   Reusable outputs for integration into malaria transmission models

## Intended users

The primary users of this portal are malaria modelers, epidemiologists, geospatial analysts, and health systems researchers.

## Dataset coverage

```{r} 
library(readr) 
library(dplyr)

hf_demo <- read_csv("data/hf_demographics.csv", show_col_types = FALSE) 
hf_services <- read_csv("data/hf_services.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)

tibble( Metric = c( "Total health facilities", "Facilities with service data", "Unique service categories" ), Value = c( n_distinct(hf_demo$facility_code),n_distinct(hf_services$facility_code), n_distinct(hf_services$general_services) ) )

```
